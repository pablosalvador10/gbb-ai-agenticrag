# Setting Up Azure AI Search Tooling with Azure AI Agents

## üìù Overview
Integrate your Azure AI Agent with Azure AI Search Tooling to unlock powerful enterprise search capabilities. Azure AI Search Tooling transforms your indexed data into a searchable format, enabling users to interact with and retrieve precise, context-rich information through natural language queries. When a user sends a query, the agent determines whether Azure AI Search Tooling should be used. If applicable, it sends the query to your search index‚Äîusing secure, role-based access‚Äîand incorporates the retrieved results into the final response.
