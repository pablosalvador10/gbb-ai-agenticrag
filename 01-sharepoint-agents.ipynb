    "## SharePoint Integration with Azure AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "SharePoint can be used as a data source to ground Azure AI Agents with documents stored securely. When a user queries, Azure AI Agents determine if SharePoint should be used. If so, the query is sent via the SharePoint tool, which checks the user's M365 copilot license and retrieves relevant documents based on the user's identity and access. The scope includes all supported documents in the SharePoint site, and responses are generated based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Existing SharePoint site with developer access\n",
    "- M365 copilot license for developers and end users\n",
    "- AOAI resource and AI project in regions: westus, japaneast, francecentral\n",
    "\n",
    "### RABC Roles\n",
    "- AI Developer role to CRUD a SharePoint tool in Azure AI Agent\n",
    "- AI Developer role for end users for OBO authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Capabilities\n",
    "- Grounding with all supported documents in a SharePoint site\n",
    "- Supported document types: PDF, Word, PPT, txt, .aspx (text data only)\n",
    "- Automatic indexing of updated documents\n",
    "- Responses based on end userâ€™s document access\n",
    "- Connection to a maximum of 1 SharePoint site\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Limitations\n",
    "- Retrieval and grounding quality issues, especially with complex formatting, tables, columns, and images\n",
    "- Text-sparse file types (e.g., PPT) may return poorer results than text-rich types (e.g., docx)\n",
    "- Grounding with specific libraries or multiple sites is not supported"
