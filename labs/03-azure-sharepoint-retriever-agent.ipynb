    "## **Setting Up SharePoint Integration (Tool) with Azure AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📝 Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "SharePoint can be used as a secure data source to ground your Azure AI Agents with documents stored in SharePoint. For example, you can connect to a SharePoint site like `contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies`. When a user sends a query, Azure AI Agents will determine whether SharePoint should be leveraged. If so, the query is sent via the SharePoint tool, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verifies if the user has an M365 Copilot license.\n",
    "2. Uses the end user's identity to retrieve relevant documents they have access to.\n",
    "3. Generates responses based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "With SharePoint integration, **On-Behalf-Of (OBO)** authentication is supported, allowing the SharePoint tool to retrieve documents based on the end user's identity and access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Existing SharePoint Site**: Developers must have access to the SharePoint site.\n",
    "2. **M365 Copilot Licenses**: Both developers and end users must have M365 Copilot licenses.\n",
    "3. **Supported Regions**: Your Azure OpenAI (AOAI) resource and AI project must be in one of the following regions:\n",
    "   - `westus`\n",
    "   - `japaneast`\n",
    "   - `francecentral`\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Developers**: Must have the **AI Developer** role to create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) a SharePoint tool in Azure AI Agent.\n",
    "- **For End Users**: Must have the **AI Developer** role to enable On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🛠️ How-To Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Verify Access to the Existing SharePoint Site: Ensure developers have the necessary permissions to access the SharePoint site:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the SharePoint site.\n",
    "2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner and select **\"Site Permissions\"**.\n",
    "3. Choose **\"Advanced Permission Settings\"**.\n",
    "4. Click on **\"Check Permissions\"** in the ribbon.\n",
    "5. Enter the developer's username or email and click **\"Check Now\"**.\n",
    "6. Review the permissions to ensure they have appropriate access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Confirm M365 Copilot Licenses for Developers and End Users: Both developers and end users must have M365 Copilot licenses. Follow these steps to verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Administrators:**\n",
    "1. Sign in to [Microsoft Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) with an admin account.\n",
    "2. Navigate to **Billing > Licenses** to view available licenses.  \n",
    "   👉 [Learn more about licensing requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-licensing).\n",
    "3. Go to **Users > Active Users**.\n",
    "4. Select a user and click on **Licenses and Apps**.\n",
    "5. Ensure the **M365 Copilot** license is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Check via Microsoft Account Portal**\n",
    "1. Go to [Microsoft Account Portal](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/).\n",
    "2. On the left sidebar, check:\n",
    "   - **My Apps** → Look for M365 Copilot.\n",
    "   - **My Access** → This may show assigned licenses.\n",
    "   - **My Groups** → If there is an M365 Copilot group, you might be assigned a license through it.\n",
    "3. If you see **My Subscriptions** or **Licenses**, click it to check if the **M365 Copilot** license is assigned to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: If you can’t find your license, contact your IT department or Microsoft 365 administrator to verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Verify Azure OpenAI (AOAI) Resource and AI Project Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your AOAI resources and AI projects are in one of the supported regions:\n",
    "- **West US**\n",
    "- **Japan East**\n",
    "- **France Central**\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ Assign Appropriate RBAC Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper RBAC roles are essential for managing SharePoint tools in Azure AI Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Developers:**\n",
    "- Must have the **AI Developer** role to CRUD a SharePoint tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For End Users:**\n",
    "- Must have the **AI Developer** role to enable OBO authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Assign Roles:**\n",
    "1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n",
    "2. Navigate to **Subscriptions** and select your subscription.\n",
    "3. Click on **Access Control (IAM)** > **Add Role Assignment**.\n",
    "4. Choose the **AI Developer** role.\n",
    "5. Select the users or groups to assign the role to and click **Save**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed these steps..\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Connection**\n",
    "   - Provide the required key-value pairs for the connection:\n",
    "   - **`resource-key`**: Your Bing resource key.\n",
    "   - **`endpoint`**: Your Bing search endpoint (typically provided in your resource details).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add a Knowledge Source**\n",
    "   - Click to add a knowledge source and select **Grounding with Bing Search** (UI) or run code below.\n",
    "   - If you don’t see this option:\n",
    "      - Verify that your resource has been created in the same resource group as your AI Agent.\n",
    "      - Ensure you have the necessary permissions."
