    "## **Setting Up Bing Integration (Tool) with Azure AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📝 Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding with Bing Search enables your Azure AI Agents to incorporate real-time public web data when generating responses. By leveraging Bing Search, your agent can fetch the latest information—such as top news or industry updates—and return relevant, cited content. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a user sends a query, the agent first determines if it should invoke Bing Search. If so, it sends a Bing search query (using only your resource key for billing and rate limiting) and retrieves search results. These results are then used to generate a final, human-readable response that includes required citations and links, as specified by Microsoft’s use and display requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: Usage of Grounding with Bing Search can incur additional costs. For pricing and legal details, review the [Bing Grounding Terms](https://www.microsoft.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grounding with Bing Search Resource**\n",
    "   - Create a Grounding with Bing Search resource using the Azure portal or a code-first approach.\n",
    "   - Ensure you have **Owner** or **Contributor** permissions to register the resource provider `Microsoft.Bing` if using a code-first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure AI Agent Setup**\n",
    "   - Ensure you have an Azure AI Agent created (via the Agent Playground or quickstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Permission/Role Assignment**\n",
    "   - **Access to Bing Search**: Users do not have access to raw search content; instead, they receive model-generated responses that include citations and links.\n",
    "   - **RBAC for Foundry Project**: End users must have the `AI Developer` role assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supported Models**\n",
    "   - Grounding with Bing Search currently works with specific Azure OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, `gpt-4-0125-preview`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a New Connection**\n",
    "   - Provide the required key-value pairs for the connection:\n",
    "   - **`resource-key`**: Your Bing resource key.\n",
    "   - **`endpoint`**: Your Bing search endpoint (typically provided in your resource details).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add a Knowledge Source**\n",
    "   - Click to add a knowledge source and select **Grounding with Bing Search**.\n",
    "   - If you don’t see this option:\n",
    "      - Verify that your resource has been created in the same resource group as your AI Agent.\n",
    "      - Ensure you have the necessary permissions.\n"

Highlight key findings, accuracy, advantages, and any notable limitations or clinical implications from recent research.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: Recent studies comparing calibration-free continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors with traditional capillary blood glucose monitoring by glucometer have highlighted several key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accuracy**: Calibration-free CGMs, such as the Freestyle Libre and Dexcom G6, generally show a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of around 10% compared to glucometers. This indicates a reliable performance, although there is a natural lag in CGMs due to the time it takes for glucose to equilibrate in interstitial fluid compared to capillary blood【3:1†source】【3:2†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Advantages**: CGMs provide continuous monitoring and trend data, allowing for better management of glucose levels over time. They are particularly useful in identifying trends and patterns that might not be captured with periodic glucometer readings【3:2†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations**: One significant limitation is the lag time of about 2 to 20 minutes between interstitial glucose readings and actual blood glucose levels, which can be problematic during rapid glucose changes such as after meals or insulin administration【3:3†source】【3:4†source】. Additionally, certain substances like Vitamin C and acetaminophen can interfere with CGM accuracy【3:4†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clinical Implications**: Understanding the physiological lag and potential interferences is crucial for clinicians. This knowledge helps in making more informed decisions regarding diabetes management, ensuring that treatment plans are tailored to individual patient needs【3:1†source】【3:4†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while CGMs offer significant advantages in terms of continuous data and ease of use, the accuracy in rapidly changing glucose conditions and potential interference from substances remain areas for careful consideration in clinical practice.\n",
