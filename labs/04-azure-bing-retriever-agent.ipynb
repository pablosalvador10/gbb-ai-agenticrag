    "## **Setting Up Bing Integration (Tool) with Azure AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📝 Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding with Bing Search enables your Azure AI Agents to incorporate real-time public web data when generating responses. By leveraging Bing Search, your agent can fetch the latest information—such as top news or industry updates—and return relevant, cited content. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a user sends a query, the agent first determines if it should invoke Bing Search. If so, it sends a Bing search query (using only your resource key for billing and rate limiting) and retrieves search results. These results are then used to generate a final, human-readable response that includes required citations and links, as specified by Microsoft’s use and display requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: Usage of Grounding with Bing Search can incur additional costs. For pricing and legal details, review the [Bing Grounding Terms](https://www.microsoft.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grounding with Bing Search Resource**\n",
    "   - Create a Grounding with Bing Search resource using the Azure portal or a code-first approach.\n",
    "   - Ensure you have **Owner** or **Contributor** permissions to register the resource provider `Microsoft.Bing` if using a code-first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure AI Agent Setup**\n",
    "   - Ensure you have an Azure AI Agent created (via the Agent Playground or quickstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Permission/Role Assignment**\n",
    "   - **Access to Bing Search**: Users do not have access to raw search content; instead, they receive model-generated responses that include citations and links.\n",
    "   - **RBAC for Foundry Project**: End users must have the `AI Developer` role assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supported Models**\n",
    "   - Grounding with Bing Search currently works with specific Azure OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, `gpt-4-0125-preview`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a New Connection**\n",
    "   - Provide the required key-value pairs for the connection:\n",
    "   - **`resource-key`**: Your Bing resource key.\n",
    "   - **`endpoint`**: Your Bing search endpoint (typically provided in your resource details).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add a Knowledge Source**\n",
    "   - Click to add a knowledge source and select **Grounding with Bing Search**.\n",
    "   - If you don’t see this option:\n",
    "      - Verify that your resource has been created in the same resource group as your AI Agent.\n",
    "      - Ensure you have the necessary permissions.\n"
