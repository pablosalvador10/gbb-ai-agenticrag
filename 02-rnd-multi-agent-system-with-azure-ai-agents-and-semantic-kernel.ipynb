    "## **Use Case Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re part of an R&D team that needs to merge structured data (e.g., experimental results, market trends) from Microsoft Fabric with unstructured documents (e.g., research reports, engineering notes) in SharePoint, then validate these findings against external references (e.g., Bing) and a high-quality “ground truth” internal knowledge stores (e.g., Azure AI Search).\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a classic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenario—multiple data sources must be queried in real time and cross-checked for consistency. However, by leveraging Azure AI agent services (an agetic enterprise-ready microservices approach) alongside frameworks like Semantic Kernel, we can evolve beyond basic RAG into a mostly autonomous, agentic system. In this design, Agentic RAG and the Reflection Pattern enable each agent to iteratively refine its output until it’s confident in delivering a high-quality, validated answer—paving the way for intelligent automation that continually learns and improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, you’re not only bringing data to the AI but also bringing AI to the data, thus maximizing the value of your knowledge stores. By leveraging state-of-the-art retrieval solutions like Azure AI Search, while also tapping sources such as SharePoint (unstructured data) and Fabric (structured data), you can harness your most valuable asset—data—to achieve new levels of insight and automation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this demo, we have two Azure AI Agents (extending beyond a single-agent architecture):**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ DataRetrievalAgent: Has access to Microsoft Fabric (for structured data) and SharePoint (for unstructured documents). Its job is to gather relevant internal data: for example, “failure rates of Material X in high-temperature tests,” or “engineering notes on prior tests.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- ValidationInsightsAgent Has access to Bing / Azure Cognitive Search for external references and can run a “reflection” or “validation” step. Its job is to cross-check what was returned by the first agent and highlight missing or conflicting information. ValidationInsightsAgent has access to highly curated knowledge sources (e.g., Azure AI Search) for validating the accuracy or truthfulness of the information it receives from DataRetrievalAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving from a single-agent setup to a multi-agent system is now simpler than ever with Semantic Kernel. The general flow looks like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user asks a question (e.g., “Retrieve historical failure rates for Material X in extreme temperatures and cross-check if new standards or conflicting data exist.”).\n",
    "2. The DataRetrievalAgent fetches structured data from Fabric (e.g., lab test results, analytics) and unstructured docs from SharePoint (e.g., research memos, engineering notes).\n",
    "3. The ValidationInsightsAgent then queries Bing/Azure Search to verify or supplement the results. Employ a reflection pattern, where it iterates over the combined results, looking for gaps or inconsistencies. If needed, it loops back to the DataRetrievalAgent for clarifications or additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the user receives a validated, summarized answer that merges internal data with external cross-checks. Thanks to the agents’ back-and-forth reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Reduced Manual Research**: Instead of manually sifting through multiple data silos and external search engines, the AI Agents automate data gathering and vetting.\n",
    "+ **Higher Confidence**: Validation ensures data accuracy and highlights missing pieces, improving R&D decision-making.\n",
    "+ **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Each agent can enforce On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication to protect sensitive data (e.g., only pulling data the user is authorized to see).\n",
