**R&D AgenticRAG** is an *Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation* system that orchestrates a **network of specialized AI agents** to automate complex research & development tasks. At its core, it uses **[Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview)** as a single-agent architecture to plan, coordinate, and refine multi‑step reasoning pipelines. Security is enforced with **[OAuth 2.0 On‑Behalf‑Of (OBO) authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)** to ensure each agent only accesses data the user is entitled to.

The idea is moving from the pattern of bringing data to the AI to making the AI go to the data at an enterprise setting. For scenarios where decisions hinge on both structured and unstructured information, this system seamlessly integrates [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/fabric) (lakehouse, warehouse, semantic model) *(currently in public preview)*, [SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/sharepoint-samples) (documents, blueprints, policies) *(currently in public preview)*, live web data via the [Bing Search API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview), and [Azure AI Search’s](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/azure-ai-search?tabs=azurecli%2Cpython&pivots=overview-azure-ai-search) combined semantic/vector capabilities. The result is a secure, real‑time orchestration layer that moves beyond one‑shot Q&A—iteratively rewriting queries, invoking the right tools, and cross‑validating results—to deliver concise, actionable insights that accelerate innovation in R&D environments.

## **🚀 Embracing Agentic RAG as a Pattern to Expand Your RAG Pipelines**

> "Agentic Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns—reflection, planning, tool use, and multi‑agent collaboration—to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows through clearly defined operational structures."  
> — *Singh et al., [Agentic Retrieval‑Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09136v3)*

Enterprises today wrestle with siloed data and rigid, one‑shot retrieval pipelines that quickly go stale. Agentic RAG empowers organizations to move beyond “thought: data” reasoning—automating continuous **search**, **validation**, and **action** across all their information sources in real time. By adopting this component‑based, autonomous agentic retrieval approach, you transform static RAG into a self‑optimizing intelligence layer—delivering governed, real‑time insights and actions at enterprise scale. Put simply, the AI does all the legwork—locating, validating, and polishing the critical retrieval step. We know LLM/SLM models are formidable, but only when they receive the right context. Put simply, the AI does all the legwork—locating, validating, and polishing the critical retrieval step. We know LLMs/SLMs are formidable, but only when they receive the right context. **Agentic RAG aims to automate that hand-off, providing an LLM with the precise information it needs at exactly the right moment.** - Fresh from Build 2025: if you’re interested in this space, I highly recommend exploring [Azure AI Search’s approach](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/introducing-agentic-retrieval-in-azure-ai-search/4414677) and the latest developments in agentic retrieval. 

## **🤖 Building Agentic Systems in Azure**

Our approach in ths repo is to keep it simple and to the point, starting with the development of robust, scalable **enterprise single agents** using the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. These production-ready agents come equipped with integrated tools, persistent memory, traceability, and isolated execution—providing a solid foundation before scaling up.

Then, of course, we'll tackle communication patterns between single agents. Just as clear conversation drives human collaboration, real-time event exchange between agents unlocks their full potential as a cohesive system. By leveraging frameworks like **Semantic Kernel**—or even crafting your own— you can establish an event-driven architecture that seamlessly ties everything together (single-agents) to build multi-agent systems. Here is my high level formula to build MaS

```text
Multi-Agent Architecture = Σ (Production-Ready Single Agents [tools, memory, traceability, isolation]) + Preferred Framework (e.g., Semantic Kernel, AutoGen)
```

**Breaking It Down**

- **Step 1:** Build robust, scalable single agents with the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**, managing them as micro-services.
- **Step 2:** For complex tasks, deploy a fleet of specialized agents that communicate seamlessly via an event-driven framework of your choice.

When Elena Reyes, a stellar Product Manager at Contoso (a MedTech company), was racing to prove her team’s next-gen CGM could meet tight clinical benchmarks, she needed reliable insights—fast. That’s when she turned to our system leveraging Agentic RAG. It deploys lean “data,” “verification,” and “synthesis” agents that automatically pull metrics from SharePoint, Fabric, and live web sources, cross-check every fact, and merge them into one traceable insight—slashing time-to-insight and boosting confidence in CGM performance decisions. Exactly what she needed to make her research more productive, one (or few) **queries bringing the right information to the right person at the right time**. 

How the system works:

1. **Planning & Intelligent Routing**  
  The **Planner Agent** parses the user question, builds an intent map, and selects the optimal retriever agents—e.g., **Fabric Retriever** (lakehouse metrics), **SharePoint Retriever** (design docs), or **Web Retriever** (market studies).  
  *Optionally*, the Planner may call the **Query Rewriter** up front to maximise retrieval precision.

2. **Retrieval**  
  The selected *family agents* run in parallel, each pulling evidence from its source of truth.

3. **Verification / Reflection Layer**  
  A dedicated **Verifier Agent** cross-checks results, detects contradictions, and confirms that the aggregated evidence actually answers the original intent.

4. **Insight Synthesis**  
  - **If verification passes:** the Planner merges validated evidence into a concise, actionable response and returns it to the user.  
  - **If verification fails:** the Verifier triggers the **Query Rewriter**, which refines the search terms; the Planner re-routes the new query to the relevant retrievers and the cycle repeats.

This closed-loop **plan → retrieve → verify → (rewrite) → synthesize** pattern ensures every answer is context-rich, conflict-free, and delivered in real time.

> [!INFO]  
> **Design Principle:** For this app rather than emergent “chatter” between many autonomous agents, we use specialized, stateless single agents orchestrated by a central Router. This yields deterministic, auditable reasoning flows—every step from retrieval to verification is logged and 'repeatable'.
