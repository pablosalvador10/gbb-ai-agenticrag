1. Install the **VS Code Python extension** if you haven't already.
2. Ensure you are in the **project root directory** (`azure-ai-agent-services-demo`).
3. Create the required Conda environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
4. Activate the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate vector-indexing-azureaisearch
   ```
5. Attach the Python kernel to the notebook in VS Code.

Once the environment is set up, you're ready to dive in! ðŸŽ‰ Open the notebook `01-run-the-demo.ipynb` and attach the kernel you created in the top-right corner. Explore a multi-agent architecture in action and see how the Semantic Kernel and Azure AI Agent services seamlessly work together with your Fabric and SharePoint. Enjoy the journey!
